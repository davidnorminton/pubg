# Getting Started with Electron with Create React App

Creating Desktop applications has come a long way. With every passing day, developers come up with easy to use options for creating desktop applications. Electron is one of those solutions. It uses web technologies wrapped around Node.js to come up with web technologies. For a more detailed introduction to the whole Electron.Js ecosystem, you can read [this article](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/cross-platform-applications-electron/).

Electron uses HTML/CSS and JavaScript traditionally. You can use HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript to build Electron applications. Other options available include using React and other JavaScript frameworks. In this article, we will accomplish the following:

- Create a React.js app using [Create-React-App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
- Install Electron into the application
- Configure Electron in the React.js app
- Finally, create a demo desktop application using Electron and React.
